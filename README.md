#Max/MSP Abstractions

This repository is a collection of random abstractions for Max and Max/MSP. 

## mspFaderConverter
Convenience abstraction for Max/MSP to convert a slider into a fader.

This abstraction takes a number input from 0. to 1, and returns an amplitude scalar representing a range from -70dB to +12dB.

The 0dB value for the abstraction is 0.80214

## Distance Calculator
This is a pretty easy one to make yourself, but hey...

It takes in two sets of coordinates (x, y, z) and calculates the distance between them. Simple and easy. This was done using normal Max objects. I have a Gen version that I'll probably upload at some point.
